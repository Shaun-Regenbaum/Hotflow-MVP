# OUT OF DATE:

Every Component needs to focus on providing its utility as simply and as thoughtfully as possible.

Every Design decision needs to ask 3 questions:

1. What does the user know?
   <br> i.e. When coming into this new context, what does the user already know and thus does not need to be explained or repeated?
2. What does the user not know?
   <br> i.e. What does the user not know that will be needed in this context, thus should be provided ASAP?
3. What will the user immediately want to know?
   <br> i.e. Once the user is done with their immediate first impression given the context, what will be their first question, or first desire that we should fulfill?
