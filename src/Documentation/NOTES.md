We need to work on the architecture of the Menu Component. It is not obvious how it works s.t. it needs a string list of titles of components and the current component, come to think of it, how will you even enact a state change based on it. It will need to be redone...

We will probably redesign the entire menu component.

When a user first arrives, what should they see? 1) What do they know?
a. They know that their should be some kind of content. 2) What don't they know?
a. That this content needs to be purchased. 3) What questions will they ask?
a. How long will it take?
b. Do I need to immediately pay?
c. How much does it cost?
