Every Component needs to focus on providing its utlity as simply and as thoughtfully as possible.

Every Design desicion needs to ask 3 questions:

1. What does the user know?
   i.e. When coming into this new context, what does the user already know and thus does not need to be explained or repeated?
2. What does the user not know?
   i.e. What does the user not know that will be needed in this context, thus should be provided ASAP?
3. What will the user immediately want to know?
   i.e. Once the user is done with their immediate first impression given the context, what will be their first question, or first desire that we should fulfill?
