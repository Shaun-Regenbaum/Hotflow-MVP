We need to work on the architecture of the Menu Component. It is not obvious how it works s.t. it needs a string list of titles of components and the current component, come to think of it, how will you even enact a state change based on it. It will need to be redone...

I also need to redo the logout button

also need to figure out what components we want in the menu
